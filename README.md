# CannonPong
This is a small Java Swing-based game that our group worked on for CprE 186 at Iowa State University. There is a release in this repo that can be downloaded and run to play the game. Java 8+ is required to run the game. It is quite difficult. Controls are presented on the start screen.

CannonPong is like a 2D basketball game. You can adjust the launch speed and angle of a ball in an attempt to shoot the ball into a cup. The cup will move around when you make it in, and your score will reset if you fail to do so.
