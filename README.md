# CannonPong

## About
CannonPong is like a 2D basketball or cup pong game. You can adjust the launch speed and angle of a ball in an attempt to shoot the ball into a cup. The cup will move around when you make it in, and your score will reset if you fail to do so.

## Purpose
This game was written as a group project for CprE 186 at Iowa State University. It used Floobits as version control in the beginning, so the other students' contributions do not show up. Due to COVID-19, our time to produce this was shortened heavily, so it is not all that complex.

## Running
To run, simply download the jar from the release, then double click the jar file to run it. Java 8 is required to run this.

## Other
This game was written using the early version of the physics found in the Java 2.5D game engine, [Pseudo3D](https://github.com/JNDev7/Pseudo3D).

This repository was originally part of an organization made for this group, but I have cloned the repo for archiving onto my account.
